# 0ngine

Game engine designed for the web, using C++ (via webassembly) and WebGL.

## Usage

To build, run `build.bat`. This outputs into the `build` folder.

To run, use `serve.bat`. This runs a quick server on the `build` folder.

Build Dependencies:
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
* [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install)

Alternatively, building can be handled with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) which does not require Emscripten, Typescript, or Sass to be installed (Python is still required)
